One of the most popular VCS tools was a system called RCS, which is still distributed with many computers today.
 RCS works by keeping patch sets (that is, the differences between files) in a special format on disk; it can 
 then re-create what any file looked like at any point in time by adding up all the patches.
Centralized Version Control Computers

The next major issue that peoples encounter is that they need to collaborate with developers on other Computers. 
To deal with this problem, Centralized Version Control Computers (CVCSs) were developed. These Computers (
    such as CVS, Subversion, and Perforce) have a single server that contains all the versioned files, 
    and a number of clients that check out files from that central place. For many years, this has been 
    the standard for version control.
